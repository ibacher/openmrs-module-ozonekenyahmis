# Ozone KenyaHMIS
==========================

This module is designed to facilitate deploying KenyaEMR / KenyaHMIS as an Ozone instance.

The major issue this module attempts to solve is the differences between how Ozone loads metadata (via Initializer) and how KenyaHMIS has historically loaded metadata (via metadata deploy packages).
